memcached Cookbook
==================
[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/opscode-cookbooks/memcached.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/opscode-cookbooks/memcached)


Installs memcached and provides a define to set up an instance of memcache via runit.


Requirements
------------
A runit service can be set up for instances using the `memcache_instance` definition.

### Platforms
- Ubuntu 10.04, 12.04
- CentOS 5.8, 6.3
- openSUSE 12.3
- SLES 12 SP2
- SmartOS base64 1.8.1 - Note that SMF directly configures memcached with no opportunity to alter settings. If you need custom parameters, use the `memcached_instance` provider instead.

May work on other systems with or without modification.

### Cookbooks
- runit


Attributes
----------
The following are node attributes passed to the template for the runit service.

- `memcached['memory']` - maximum memory for memcached instances.
- `memcached['user']` - user to run memcached as.
- `memcached['port']` - TCP port for memcached to listen on.
- `memcached['udp_port']` - UDP port for memcached to listen on.
- `memcached['listen']` - IP address for memcache to listen on, defaults to **0.0.0.0** (world accessible).
- `memcached['maxconn']` - maximum number of connections to accept (defaults to 1024)
- `memcached['max_object_size']` - maximum size of an object to cache (defaults to 1MB)
- `memcached['logfilename']` - logfile to which memcached output will be redirected in /var/log/$logfilename.


Usage
-----
Simply set the attributes and it will configure the `/etc/memcached.conf` file. If you want to use multiple memcached instances, you'll need to modify the recipe to disable the startup script and the template in the default recipe.

Use the definition, `memcached_instance`, to set up a runit service for the named memcached instance.

```ruby
memcached_instance 'myproj'
```

The recipe also reads in whether to start up memcached from a `/etc/default/memcached` "ENABLE_MEMCACHED" setting, which is "yes" by default.
